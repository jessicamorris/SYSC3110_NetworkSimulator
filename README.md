SYSC3110 Project: Network Simulator
===================================

This repository contains all of the code from the SYSC3110 Third Year Software Engineering Project group project. I have made a lot of modifications and improvements to the code since then, so what I have uploaded here is very different from my team's final project submission.

Project Requirements
--------------------

The original requirements of the project were:

Create a simulator which simulates the movement of datagram packets within a network. Users can configure the topology of the network by adding and removing routers and edges, and configure the simulation by setting the rate at which packets are injected, and select a routing algorithm.
In addition to this, the network topology can be saved to an XML file, and imported.

Additions
---------

Remaining work I would like to do to improve the project:

0. Write remaining unit tests for the model.
0. Re-implement the properly-working logging and undoing.
0. Add more routing algorithms.
0. Add a panel for viewing routers' routing tables.
0. Make simulation results export to CSV or Excel spreadsheets.
